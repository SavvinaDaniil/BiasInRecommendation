# BiasInRecommendation
In this repository, we are working on studying propagation of bias towards author groups in a book recommendation setting.

We are applying our research methods to the Book-Crossing dataset, as processed in our repository <a href =https://github.com/SavvinaDaniil/EnrichBookCrossing> EnrichBookCrossing</a>. 

## Order
1. Book data analysis
2. Book Recommendation (on Colab)
3. Book results analysis

Certain code segments taken from <a href = "https://github.com/rahmanidashti/FairBook"> Fairbook </a>.
